## Reconnaissance

* __Pasive footprinting__ or __OSINT__ Open Source Intelligence
>Involves gathering information about the target without their awareness
>All the information we can get from outside, by public sources:
* WHOIS Databases
* Search Engines
* Social Networks
* Web Pages
* Job postings that need to inform the vacancy requirements
* Geo-Labeled pictures 
<br/>

* __Data to get:__
>Networking:
* Domains
* Net segments
* IP direction
* DNS Servers

>Systems:
* Operative Systems
* Web Technologies
* Location

>Organization
* Names
* Phone numbers
* E-mails
* News


## PROTECTION AND ANONYMITY

* Assessing your anonymity while browsing the Internet:

* Virtual Machine __Trace Labs OSINT__ to researches:

* Extensions for browsers:
>Ublock Origin
>Privacy Badger
>User-Agent Switcher and Manager

## SEARCH TIPS

* site
>site: domain.com something

* intitle
>intitle: something interesting

* inurl
>inurl: hacking

* link
>link: mywebsite.com

* type

## WHOIS

* In some countries is not allowed to show data from __whois__
* In other countries, some domain __registrars__ charge for hide this information
* __viewdns.info__

### Certificate Transparency: The New WHOIS

* WHOIS data is no longer readily available
* There is another source through the Certificate Transparency service

---

Web browsers do a good job in detecting malicious websites. <br/>

By using __SSL/TLS certificates__ and employing __HTTP Strict Transport Security__ 
features on web servers, browsers can identify an imposter site 
attempting to impersonate a legitimate one. <br/>

However, what browsers don't do well is identify the presence of 
a malicious certificate issued by a Certification Authority _(CA)_ <br/>

__Certificate Transparency__ is a requirement for CAs where they must publish records of 
all issued certificates. <br/>

The records data undergoes scrutiny and audits, allowing other CAs to identify 
any suspicious activity. <br/>

---

* We can check the available Certificate Transparency search services from 
various sources, for example: __https://crt.sh__ <br/>

* We can check __WEBBACK MACHINE__ for older versions of webs.

## EMAIL FOOTPRINTING

* Is the process of gathering emails accounts
* We can search in google, but there are other tools
* Email accounts may have a format like name.surname
* We can use harvester in _Kali Linux_
* The command _theHarvester_ by itself, give us help
* Lets get 5 email accounts from udg.mx from bing:
>theHarvester -d udg.mx -b bing -l 5

* Also can use: 
>https://haveibeenpwned.com
>https://www.osintframework.com/
>https://spiderfoot.net.


## SCANNING
__Active Footprinting or OSINT__

* Discover Active Hosts to get a list of IP addresses
* Discover open ports in every IP address
* identify software 
* Discover OS

### Six Flags of TCP

* __SYN__ The beginning of 3-Hand-shake
* __ACK__ Confirm the reception of a transmission and secuence number
* __PSH__ When 1 the receiver must inform about stored data
* __URG__ When 1, receiver gives priority and stop other processes
* __FIN__ When 1, there will not be more transmisions
* __RST__ When error, turns to 1. Useful to scan ports

### 3 Hand Shake

>PC sends __SYN, 100__ to SERV
>SERV sends __ACK, 101__ and its __SYN, 200__ to PC
>PC responds with __ACK, 201__
* Now there is a __connection__

### Test the 3 Hand Shake

_PC1_ <br/>
* Init a service of __Netcat__ 
* Active Listening, Disable name resolution, Verbose and add port 50000
>nc -lnvp 50000

_PC2_ <br/>
* Open _wireshark_
* Use filer: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx and not arp (x...->PC1 IP address)
* In terminal:
>nc -nvv xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 50000
* We can send messages from terminal
* _Ctrl+c_ to cancel communication

### Test UDP

* The same, but command for PC1:
>nc -lunvvp 60000
* Command for PC2:
>nc -nvvu xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 60000
* We can see that _wireshark_ does not show anything, until we send messages

### Active Hosts Detection

We must use plenty of tools to detect host

__Netdiscovery__ <br/>
* uses ARP _(Address Resolution Protocol)_
* Devices send ARP requests as broadcast type
>sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.132.0/24 -i eth0

__Nmap__ <br/>
* A variant for Nmap is _-sn_ and works with:
* ICMP Ping Requests
* TCP SYN Scan at 443 port
* TCP ACK Scan at 80 port
* A ICMP time-stamp request
>sudo nmap -sn 10.0.0.0/24

* In Kali do a ping sweep:
>fping -a -g 192.168.10.0/24 2> /dev/null

* Now an ARP request:
>sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.10.0/24

* Composed ping:
>sudo nmap -sn 192.168.10.254 -T4 --disable-arp

#### TCP Connect Scanning

* Use it when you can not do a TCP SYN scanning
* Use it if you do not have root permissions
* Do not use TCP connect _if you have TCP SYN_
* TCP Connect uses the Operative System to stablish connections
* The OS stablish a TCP connection with the target and its ports
* The OS stablish the 3 hand-shake
>nmap -sT 192.168.132.1

#### TCP SYN Scanning

* Known as _stealthy_ scan
* Start, but do not complet the whole process of 3 Hand-shake
* In the 3rd step, sends __RST__
>sudo nmap -sS 192.168.132.1

#### UDP port Scanning

* DNS, NTP, SNMP use UDP
* You must always include a UDP Scan in a penetration test
* Used to be _very slow_
>sudo nmap -sU 192.168.132.1
* If port is open, the application responds
* The Scan registers the _datagram_
* The Scan responds with a __ICMP packet__ _"port unreachable"_

#### Range of Ports Scanning

* We can give a range of ports as a parameter with __-p__
>sudo nmap -sS 192.168.132.1 -p 1-100
>sudo nmap -sS 192.168.132.1 -p 137-139, 145
* We can see open ports:
>netstat -antup | less
>netstat -antup | grep :511
>netstat -antup | grep udp

## Nessus

* Register on: http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-home/ <br/>
* Open a __root__ terminal and go to Download folder <br/>
* __dpkg -i__ and add the file name <br/>

>You can start Nessus Scanner by typing /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
>Then go to https://kali:8834/ to configure your scanner

## TIP for MAC üçé‚Ää
To access a folder in our network, we choose "Go" in the main menu. <br/>
Then "Conect to server" <br/>
Write, for example: "smb:\\172.16.xxx.xxx"<br/>
