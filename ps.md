# POWERSHELL

Windows Powershell introduces the concept of __cmdlet__ (pronounced _commandlet_) <br/>

You use cmdlets the same way you use any other commands and utilities. <br/>

They are not _case sensistive_ <br/>

For ease of reference, cmdlets are named using __verb-noun__ pairs.

## Starting

Let's try looking for aliases: <br/>

>get-alias dir

Realize that the real command for _dir_ or _ls_ is __get-childitem__ <br/>
