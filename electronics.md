# ELECTRONICS

## VOLTAGE

Conducts electrical energy with greater o lesser power. <br/>
Its units are __Volts__ <br/>

__VOLTAGE IS POTENTIAL__ <br/>


## CURRENT

The meaning of current in electronics is close to that of the current in a river. <br/><br/>

Its the amount of charge carried by electrons passing a point in a wire per second. <br/><br/>

The unit of current is the __Ampere__ abbreviate as _amp_<br/><br/>

__CURRENT IS ELECTRICITY IN ACTION__ <br/>


## RESISTENCE

Is the opposition to the flow of electrons to move through a conductor. <br/>
Its unit is __Ohms__ <br/>

## Ohms

Is the measure for Electrical Resistence <br/>

### Insulator

Material that has very high resistence to electricity, like the plastic sheaths around wires.

### Conductor

Material with very LOW resistence to electricity as copper, aluminium, silver and gold.

## Ohm Law

I = V/R <br/>
V = I*R <br/>
R = V/I <br/>

* __R__ Resistence
* __I__ Current
* __V__ Voltage

## POWER

The units of power are __WATTS__ <br/>

power = (current)2 * resistence <br/>


## MATERIALS

* Pliers
* Multimeter
* 9v battery (Alkaline, NOT rechargeable)
* 1.5 AA batteries (Alkaline, NOT rechargeable)
* Battery holders, connectors, alligator clips
* Fuses (Mini-blade Automotive style, 3 Amp)
* Potentiometer (Panel mount, Single turn, 2k linear, 0.1 - 0.5 watts)
* Resistors (1/4-watt, 470, 1k, 2k, 2.2 ohms)
* LED [Light Emitting Diode] Any size and color
* Protoboard

### The Meter

* Black wire (lead) is for COM
* Red wire (lead) is for V

__PRECISION vs ACCURACY__ <br/>

__Precision__ is give the same results <br/>
__Accuracy__ is give the right result <br/>

### PROTOBOARD

* Lines with numbers are communicated 
* The 2 lines in both sides between lines pink and blue are communicated too


### USB 2.0

* Has 4 cables
* Black: Negative
* Red: Positive
* White: Data +
* Green: Data -

### COMPONENTS TECHNOLOGY

* Through Hole Techonoly (THT)
* Surface Mount Device (SMD)

### CAPACITORS

Used to store and release Electrical Energy in a circuit. <br/>
Its main function is to store electrical charge and release it when neccessary.
