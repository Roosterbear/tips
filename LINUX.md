### path expansion ‚ô®Ô∏è‚Ää

We can open, list or name a file with characters like a dash with path expansion. <br/>

## Process in Linux

### ps
Display user processes. <br/>
We can use the options below: <br/>

__a__: Display all user, not only about the terminal in use. <br/>
__u__: A detailed exit or _user-oriented_ with much more information. <br/>
__x__: Display all the processes, including those not associated with any terminal, like daemons. <br/>

```terminal
ps aux
```

<br/>
__actual process id:__ $$ <br/>
__process folder:__ cd /proc <br/>
__folder to actual process:__ cd $$ <br/>
__executable of current task:__ ls -l exe <br/>
<br/>

__lsof__ _list open files_ <br/>

Give us detailed information about files used in current processes. <br/>
Normally requires Admin privileges. <br/>

__We can list files that are listening TCP connections by:__ <br/>

```terminal
sudo lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -n -P
```
__top__

Lists the processes running in the system. <br/>

<br/>

_shift+m_ orders by memory use.
_shift+p_ orders by CPU use.
_shift+n_ orders by process.

__htop__

A better version of __top__ which we can easily install. <br/>

__free__

We can see the use of memmory of the system. It is better with _-h_ (for Humans) <br/>

## grep

Command used as a filter to search keywords to find information. Usually used with __pipes__ (|). <br/>


__find lines with a text__ <br/>

```terminal
grep file file.txt
```

Where __file__ is the _word to find_ and __file.txt__ is the _file_ where it has to look. <br/>

__find lines with a text and the line number__ <br/>

```terminal
grep file file.txt -n
```
We can use _-c_ to count the lines. <br/>
We can use _-w_ to look only separate words. <br/>

## pipes |

Sends the output of a command to another command. <br/>

__list the current folder, only the first 20 lines and withe the word "root" in it.__ <br/>

```terminal
ls -al | head -20 | grep root
```

__find all process with the word apache2__

```terminal
ps aux | grep apache2
```

__find line numbers where is a text__ <br/>

```terminal
grep file file.txt -n | cut -d ":" -f 1
```

## sed (Stream EDitor)

We can replace text: <br/>

```terminal
echo "hello there" | sed 's/there/here/'
```


We can delete lines: <br/>

```terminal
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt 
```


We can delete lines: <br/>

```terminal
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt 
```

---

## SYSTEMCTL

__Status__ <br/>

```terminal
sudo systemctl status apache
```

__Enable service__ <br/>

```terminal
sudo systemctl enable apache
```

## LOGS

We can find them in: <br/>
>/var/log


__status__ <br/>

```

__times system was reboot__ <br/>

```terminal
sudo systemctl --list-boots
```

__info by level__ <br/>

```terminal
sudo systemctl -p crit
sudo systemctl -p err
sudo systemctl -p info
```

#### installing stuff

Before installing something, maybe we want to know if it is available. <br/>

```terminal
apt-cache search snort
```

Now we can install: <br/>

```terminal
apt-get install [packagename]
```

We can uninstall: <br/>

```terminal
apt-get remove [packagename]
```

To check if there are updates in the lists of repositories we can type: <br/>

```terminal
apt-get update
```

If so, the updates are downloaded. <br/>

To __upgrade__ to a new version our installed packages, we can use: <br/>

```terminal
apt-get upgrade
```

__Knowing the console we are working with__ <br/>

Just type: <br/>

```terminal
echo $SHELL
```

__show gateways__ <br/>

>route -n


## Vi

>vi file.txt

__i__ Insert Mode <br/>

_Esc_ Exit to command mode <br/>

__:w__ Save <br/>

__:q__ Exit <br/>

__:q!__ Exit without save <br/>

__:x__ Save and Exit <br/>

_x_ Deletes a character <br/>

_3x_ Deletes 3 characters <br/>

_dd_ Deletes a line <br/>

_3dd_ Deletes 3 lines <br/>

_dw_ Deletes a word <br/>

_p_ Paste before the cursor <br/>

_P_ Paste after the cursor <br/>

_o_ Insert below line <br/>

_O_ Paste above line <br/>



#### Create a script

We can edit a new file with vi: <br/>

```terminal
vi sayHello.sh
```

Now we must write: __#!/bin/bash__ <br/>
Then we can add any command, like: 

```terminal
echo "Hello world"
```

Save our file with __:wq__ <br/>

We give _execute_ permissions to the file with: <br/>
```terminal
chmod +x sayHello.sh
```

Then we just run: __./sayHello.sh__ <br/>


#### Run any script from anywhere

Check: <br/>

```terminal
echo $PATH
```

The first line before ":" tell us the path where we have to copy our script:

```terminal
vi hola
```

Add: <br/>

```terminal
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hola "$@
```

And then: <br/>
```terminal
chmod +x hola
cp hola /home/lf/.local/bin/
```

__Now we can run:__

```terminal
hola Fernando
```

__A script to change a sentence from lowercase to uppercase__

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo $@ | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```

or <br/>

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo $@ | tr '[:lower]' '[:upper]' 
```

<br/>

__ctrl+a__ <br/>

__ctrl+e__ <br/>
Go to the end of the line. <br/>

---

__alt+b__ <br/>
Jump to the last command in the line. <br/>

__alt+f__ <br/>
Jump to the next command in the line. <br/>

---

__ctrl+u__ <br/>
Deletes from cursor to the beginning of the line. <br/>

__ctrl+k__ <br/>
Deletes from cursor to the end of the line. <br/>

__ctrl+w__ <br/>
Deletes the word (_every space separates a word_) before the cursor in the line. <br/>

__alt+d__ <br/>
Deletes the word (_every space separates a word_) after the cursor in the line. <br/>

---

__ctrl+l__ <br/>
Clears the terminal without deleting the __current line__. <br/>

__ctrl+d__ <br/>
Deletes the character after cursor or close the terminal if there is nothing 

__ctrl+t__
Exchange the characters with each other.

---

__ctrl+alt+t__ <br/>
Opens a new terminal. <br/>

__add the output of a command to a file__ <br/>

```terminal
ls > file.txt
```

__add the output of a command to a file without deleting the last information__ <br/>

```terminal
ls >> file.txt
```

__delete the content of a file__ <br/>

```terminal
cat dev/null > file.txt
```

#### save the path of a directory

```terminal
pushd .
```

Now we can change the directory and get back with: <br/>

```terminal
popd
```

#### history

To show all commands we typed, we use: _history_ <br/>

To delete a line of history we type: _history -d xxxx_ <br/>
Where _xxxx_ is the number of the command.

__avoiding to register a command in history__ <br/>
 We just have to let a blank space before the command. üëåüèæ‚Ää<br/>

__number of lines of history__ <br/>

```terminal
echo $HISTSIZE
```

__knowing the default editor__ <br/>

```terminal
echo $EDITOR
```

__modify and run the last command__ <br/>

```terminal
fc
```
We just modify the line and the command will be executed. <br/>


#### Find

__files__ <br/>

```terminal
find . -type f -iname *.py
```
. from current directory <br/>
__f__ files <br/>
_iname_ it dowsn't matter if it's uppercase or lowercase. <br/>
That contains the _py_ extension. <br/>

__directories__ <br/>

```terminal
find ~ -type d -iname *python*
```

~ from home directory <br/>
__d__ directories <br/>
_iname_ it doesn't matter if it's uppercase or lowercase. <br/>
That contains the word _python_ <br/>


__math operations__

```terminal
echo 3+2 | bc
expr 3 + 2
echo $((3+2))
```

#### tar

Stands for "tape archive" and is used to combine files into one archive. <br/>

__combine files__ <br/>

```terminal
tar -cvf texts.tar text1 text2 text3
```

__display files__ <br/>

```terminal
tar -tvf texts.tar
```

__extract files__ <br/>

```terminal
tar -xf texts.tar
```

Where __c__ is for create, __v__ is for _verbose_ and __f__ is for write the _following file_ <br/>

#### compress

__bzip2__ with extension _.tar.bz2_ is the slowest but generates the __smallest__ files.
__compress__ with extension _.tar.z_ is the fastest but generates the __biggest__ files.
__gzip__ with extension _.tar.gz2_ or _.tgz_ falls somewhere in between.
