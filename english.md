* What's got into ya?
* I picked it up on sale
* Make believe it's my foot and smash it
* I've been briefed on the plan
* What's your assessment?
* You will be allowed out into the Quad
* You have seen these orange wires running throughout this building
* These are wired to explosives
* If one of these wires is cut
* If any of the individual explosives are tampered with
* We managed to stay together anyway
* Here we go!
* I will not hesitate
* That could damn well get them killed
* I don't give a damn
* You might as well come with us
* None of us can sleep, specially with you two yapping
* They are being urged
* I was attempting to be sarcastic
* Any second now
* Could we guarantee no casualties among the hostages? 
* Cut a deal
* Tell Computers and Humans apart 
* That's a wrap
* Picture this
* You just disappeared up your own ass hole, you know that?
* Poke and Prod
* Bear in mind
* Beating around the bush
* Far as we know
* Once I drive away, I'm not coming back
* I wanna know what that is you're playing
* You're having withdrawal symptoms?
* Go to great lengths
