### Definition of Cybersecurity

The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity <br/>
and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, <br/>
people and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation <br/>


### Threat Actor

Person or group who presents a security risk.


### Security Analyst

Are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.


### Skills

> Communication
> Collaboration
> Analysis
> Problem solving

---

> Programming Languages
> Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
> Computer Forensic

### Personal Information

__PII__ - Personal Identifiable Information <br/>
__SPII__ - Sensitive Personal Identifiable Information <br/>

### Social Engineering

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, <br/>
access or valuables <br/>


### Phishing

The use of digital communications to trick people <br/>
into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. <br/>

The __Spear phishing__ ("_dirigido_") is a targeted attack on a specific person <br/>
or group of people that appears to come from reliable source. <br/>

__Whaling__ is for high ranking people in an organization. <br/>

__Business Email Compromise__ is when a threat agent pretends to be a person <br/>
known to the victim and tries to get them to send money or provide confidential <br/>
company information. <br/>

__Vishing__ By voice (telephone)

__Watering Hole__ A threat actor compromises a website frequently visited <br/>
by a specific group of users. <br/>

__USB Baiting__ By a malicious software in a USB


### CISSP Domains

> __Security and risk management__ [Goals and Objectives, compliance and law]
> __Asset Security__ [Storage, maintenance, retention or destruction of data]
> __Security Architecture and Engineering__ [Optimizes Tools and Systems]
> __Communication and Network Security__ [Manage and secures networks]
> __Identity and access management__ [Users to follow policies to control assets]
> __Security Assessment and Testing__ [Audits to monitor risks]
> __Security Operations__ [Investigations and preventive measures]
> __Software Development Security__ [Secure Coding Practices]


### Components of Security Frameworks

1.- Identifying and documenting security goals
2.- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3.- Implementing strong security processes
4.- Monitoring and communicating results


### CIA Triad (_is a guide or model that inform about organization risk_)

- [] __Confidentiality__ - Only authorized user can access _SPECIFIC_ assets or data
- [] __Integrity__ - Data is _CORRECT_, authentic and reliable
- [] __Availability__ - Data is accesible to those who are _AUTHORIZED_ to access it


### Ethical Principles

1.- Confidentiality - PII confidential and safe
2.- Privacy Protections - Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use
3.- Laws - Rules recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity


### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

> Collects and analyzes LOG data to monitor critical activities as Splunk or Chronicle


### Professional Declaration

[
Currently I work in the IT Departament of a university.
To Manage personal information and Databases are one of my duties.
I sure that it is very important to keep information safe and inform about Security Risks.

I'm very interested in security, though there were attacks in my job, and I want to help.
I like to think like an attacker y make undestructibles ways of defense.
I'm excited about make traps to attackers and get some fun about it.

I'm love programming and make very useful tools for users or administrators.
I have facility for both written and verbal communication and I like to program
I'm a pragmatic person and I like take care of details
