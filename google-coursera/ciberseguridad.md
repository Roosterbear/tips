### Security Analyst

Are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.


### Skills

> Communication
> Collaboration
> Analysis
> Problem solving

---

> Programming Languages
> Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
> Computer Forensic

### Personal Information

__PII__ - Personal Identifiable Information <br/>
__SPII__ - Sensitive Personal Identifiable Information <br/>

### Social Engineering

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, <br/>
access or valuables <br/>


### Phishing

The use of digital communications to trick people <br/>
into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. <br/>

The __Spear phishing__ ("_dirigido_") is a targeted attack on a specific person <br/>
or group of people that appears to come from reliable source. <br/>

__Whaling__ is for high ranking people in an organization. <br/>

__Business Email Compromise__ is when a threat agent pretends to be a person <br/>
known to the victim and tries to get them to send money or provide confidential <br/>
company information. <br/>

__Vishing__ By voice (telephone)

__Watering Hole__ A threat actor compromises a website frequently visited <br/>
by a specific group of users. <br/>

__USB Baiting__ By a malicious software in a USB


### CISSP Domains

> __Security and risk management__ [Goals and Objectives, compliance and law]
> __Asset Security__ [Storage, maintenance, retention or destruction of data]
> __Security Architecture and Engineering__ [Optimizes Tools and Systems]
> __Communication and Network Security__ [Manage and secures networks]
> __Identity and access management__ [Users to follow policies to control assets]
> __Security Assessment and Testing__ [Audits to monitor risks]
> __Security Operations__ [Investigations and preventive measures]
> __Software Development Security__ [Secure Coding Practices]


### Components of Security Frameworks

1.- Identifying and documenting security goals
2.- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3.- Implementing strong security processes
4.- Monitoring and communicating results


### CIA Triad (_is a guide or model that inform about organization risk_)

- [] __Confidentiality__ - Only authorized user can access _SPECIFIC_ assets or data
- [] __Integrity__ - Data is _CORRECT_, authentic and reliable
- [] __Availability__ - Data is accesible to those who are _AUTHORIZED_ to access it


### Ethical Principles

1.- Confidentiality - PII confidential and safe
2.- Privacy Protections - Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use
3.- Laws - Rules recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity


### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

> Collects and analyzes LOG data to monitor critical activities as Splunk or Chronicle

## [2] Play Safe: Manage Security Risks üîêüîêüîêüîêüîêüîêüîê


### CISSP Domain #1 - Security and Risk Management

Focused on defining security goals and objectives, <br/>
risk mitigation, compliance[cumplimiento], business continuity <br/>
and legal regulations. <br/>

__Risk Mitigation__ <br/>
The process of having the right _procedures and rules_ <br/>
in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach[infraccion]. <br/>

__Business continuity__ <br/>
An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity <br/>
by establishing risk disaster _recovery plans_. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #2 - Asset Security

Focused on _securing_ digital and physical _assets_. <br/>
It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention <br/>
and _destruction_ of data. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #3 - Security Architecture and Engineering

Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring _effective tools_, <br/>
systems and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data. <br/>

__Shared responsability__ <br/>
All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk <br/>
and maintaining both physical and virtual security. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #4 - Communication and Network Security

Focused on managing and securing physical _networks and wireless communications_. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #5 - Identity and access management

Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users <br/>
follow established policies to control and manage assets. _(Not to use the same user_) <br/>

* IAM 

> __Identification__ Verification of the users who they are
> __Authentication__ Verification process to prove the identity
> __Authorization__ Related to their level of access after confirmed identity
> __Accountability__ Monitoring and recording user actions


### CISSP Domain #6 - Security Assessment and Testing

Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data <br/>
and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats and vulnerabilities. <br/>
_Find better ways_ <br/>


### CISSP Domain #7 - Security Operations

Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventive measures. <br/>



### CISSP Domain #8 - Software Development Security 

Focused on using secure coding practices. <br/>

__THREAD__ <br/>
Any circumstance or event that can _negatively impact_ assets <br/>

__RISK__ <br/>
The posibility of a threat to impact the confidentiality, <br/>
integrity or availability of an asset. <br/>

__VULNERABILITY__ <br/>
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat. <br/>
[Outdated firewall-software, weak password, unprotected data and PEOPLE] <br/>

__SOCIAL ENGINEERING__ <br/>
A manipulation technique that exploits _human error_ <br/>
to gain private information, access or valuables. <br/>
_phishing_ is a way of social engineering. <br/>

__RANSOMWARE__ <br/>
A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data <br/>
and demand payment to restore access. <br/>

__DEEP WEB__ <br/>
Generally requires authorization to access it. [intranet]<br/>

__DARK WEB__ <br/>
Can only be accessed by using special software. [criminals]<br/>


__CyberSecurity Framework__ [CSF]<br/>
Part of _National Institute of Standards and Technology_ [NIST] <br/>
A voluntary framework that consist of standards, <br/>
guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. <br/>

Its _CORE_ functions are: <br/> 

* Identify -> Manage Risk and its effect
* Protect -> Strategy to mitigate by policies, procedures, training and tools
* Detect -> Identify potential incidents - Improving monitoring to speed detections
* Respond -> Proper procedures to contain, neutralize, analyze incidents - improvements
* Recover -> Returning affected systems back to normal operation

Used for -> MANAGE RISK, IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES AND LEARN FROM MISTAKES<br/>

__S.P. 800-53__ <br/>
Aunified framework for protecting the security of information systems <br/>
within the federal government. <br/>

__RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK__ [RMF]<br/>

* Prepare _Necessary Activities before a breach occurs_
* Categorize _Risk management processes and tasks_
* Select _Documentation of Controls_
* Implement _Plans of Security and Privacy_
* Assess[valoraciones] _if controlas are correct_
* Authorize _being accountable[responsable] for privacy risks in an organization_
* Monitor _be aware of how systems are operating_

__Security Frameworks__ <br/>
_Guidelines_ used for _building plans_ to help mitigate risk and threats <br/>
to data and privacy <br/>

__Encryption__ <br/>
The process of converting data from a readable format to an _encoded_ format. <br/>
Used to ensure confidentiality of sensitive data. <br/>

__Ciphertext__ <br/>
Is the raw encoded message that is _unreadable_ to humans and computers. <br/>
Can't be readable until it's been decrypted into its original plaintext form. <br/>

__Authentication__ <br/>
The process of verifying who someone or something is. (_login_)<br/>
More advanced is Multi-factor authentication (_MFA_) that <br/>
challenge the user to demostrate that they are who they claim to be <br/>
with additional form of authentication as a security code, biometrics. <br/>

__Biometrics__ <br/>
Unique physical characteristics thet can be used to verify a person identity. <br/>
[fingerprint],[eye-scan],[palm-scan] and [voice]<br/>

__Vishing__ <br/>
The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information <br/>
or to impersonate a known source. <br/>

__Authorization__ <br/>
The Concept of granting access to specific resources within a system. <br/>

__Controls__ <br/>
Used to reduce the impact of a threat, risk or vulnerability, and are: <br/>

* [Physical] Doors, Guards, CCTV, Access cards
* [Technical] Firewalls, Multi-Factor Authentication, Antivirus
* [Administrative] Function separation, Authorization, Assets Clasification


@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
__Open Web Applications Security Project__ [OWASP] <br/>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Principles: <br/>

* Minimize attack surface area -> _all potential vulnerabilities_
* Principle of __LEAST__ Privilege -> _just the access required to their everyday tasks_
* Defense in Depth -> _multiple security controls_
* Separation of duties -> _no one should be given so many privileges_
* Keep security simple -> _avoid unnecessarily complicated solutions_
* Fix security issues correctly -> _identify root cause, correct and test to ensure_
