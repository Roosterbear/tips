# Cybersecurity

## Foundations of Cybersecurity 🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐

### Cybersecurity Activities

> Detect and respond to attacks
> Monitoring and protecting networks
> Investigating incidents
> Write code to automate task


### Definition of Cybersecurity

The practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity <br/>
and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, <br/>
people and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation <br/>


### Threat Actor

Person or group who presents a security risk.


### Security Analyst

Are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.


### Skills

> Communication
> Collaboration
> Analysis
> Problem solving

> Programming Languages
> Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Tools
> Computer Forensic

### Personal Information

__PII__ - Personal Identifiable Information <br/>
__SPII__ - Sensitive Personal Identifiable Information <br/>

### Social Engineering

A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, <br/>
access or valuables <br/>


### Phishing

The use of digital communications to trick people <br/>
into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. <br/>

The __Spear phishing__ ("_dirigido_") is a targeted attack on a specific person <br/>
or group of people that appears to come from reliable source. <br/>

__Whaling__ is for high ranking people in an organization. <br/>

__Business Email Compromise__ is when a threat agent pretends to be a person <br/>
known to the victim and tries to get them to send money or provide confidential <br/>
company information. <br/>

__Vishing__ By voice (telephone)

__Watering Hole__ A threat actor compromises a website frequently visited <br/>
by a specific group of users. <br/>

__USB Baiting__ By a malicious software in a USB


### CISSP Domains

> __Security and risk management__ [Goals and Objectives, compliance and law]
> __Asset Security__ [Storage, maintenance, retention or destruction of data]
> __Security Architecture and Engineering__ [Optimizes Tools and Systems]
> __Communication and Network Security__ [Manage and secures networks]
> __Identity and access management__ [Users to follow policies to control assets]
> __Security Assessment and Testing__ [Audits to monitor risks]
> __Security Operations__ [Investigations and preventive measures]
> __Software Development Security__ [Secure Coding Practices]


### Components of Security Frameworks

1.- Identifying and documenting security goals
2.- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3.- Implementing strong security processes
4.- Monitoring and communicating results


### CIA Triad (_is a guide_)

- [] __Confidentiality__ - Only authorized user can access specific assets or data
- [] __Integrity__ - Data is correct, authentic and reliable
- [] __Availability__ - Data is accesible to those who are authorized to access it


### Ethical Principles

1.- Confidentiality - PII confidential and safe
2.- Privacy Protections - Safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use
3.- Laws - Rules recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity


### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Tools

> Collects and analyzes LOG data to monitor critical activities as Splunk or Chronicle

## Play Safe: Manage Security Risks 🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐🔐


### CISSP Domain #1 - Security and Risk Management

Focused on defining security goals and objectives, <br/>
risk mitigation, compliance[cumplimiento], business continuity <br/>
and legal regulations. <br/>

__Risk Mitigation__ <br/>
The process of having the right _procedures and rules_ <br/>
in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach[infraccion]. <br/>

__Business continuity__ <br/>
An organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity <br/>
by establishing risk disaster _recovery plans_. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #2 - Asset Security

Focused on _securing_ digital and physical _assets_. <br/>
It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention <br/>
and _destruction_ of data. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #3 - Security Architecture and Engineering

Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring _effective tools_, <br/>
systems and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data. <br/>

__Shared responsability__ <br/>
All individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk <br/>
and maintaining both physical and virtual security. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #4 - Communication and Network Security

Focused on managing and securing physical _networks and wireless communications_. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #5 - Identity and access management

Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users <br/>
follow established policies to control and manage assets. <br/>


### CISSP Domain #5 - Identity and access management

Focused on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, <br/>
and conducting security audits to monitor
