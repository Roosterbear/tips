1.- Identifying and documenting security goals
2.- Setting guidelines to achieve security goals
3.- Implementing strong security processes
4.- Monitoring and communicating results

## CIA Triad (_is a guide_)

- [] __Confidentiality__ - Only authorized user can access specific assets or data
- [] __Integrity__ - Data is correct, authentic and reliable
- [] __Availability__ - Data is accesible to those who are authorized to access it
