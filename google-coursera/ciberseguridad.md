### Phishing

The use of digital communications to trick people <br/>
into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. <br/>

The __Spear phishing__ ("_dirigido_") is a targeted attack on a specific person <br/>
or group of people that appears to come from reliable source. <br/>

__Whaling__ is for high ranking people in an organization. <br/>

__Business Email Compromise__ is when a threat agent pretends to be a person <br/>
known to the victim and tries to get them to send money or provide confidential <br/>
company information. <br/>
 
__Vishing__ By voice (telephone) <br/>

__Watering Hole__ A threat actor compromises a website frequently visited <br/>
by a specific group of users. <br/>
