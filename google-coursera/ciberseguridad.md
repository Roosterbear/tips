rshqvvo dhv-256-fef -sengi2 -d -g -lq T1.hqfubswhg -rxw T1.uhfryhuhg -n hwwxeuxwh <br/>


```bash
cat .leftShift3 | tr "d-za-cD-ZA-C" "a-zA-Z"
```

_Note:_ <br/>
The __tr__ command translates text from one set of characters to another, <br/>
using a mapping. <br/>
The first parameter to the __tr__ command represents the input <br/>
set of characters, <br/>
and the second represents the output set of characters. <br/> 
Hence, if you provide parameters “abcd” and “pqrs”, <br/>
and the input string to the __tr__ command <br/>
is “ac”, the output string will be “pr". <br/>


```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -d -in Q1.encrypted -out Q1.recovered -k ettubrute
```

Although you don't need to memorize this command, <br/>
to help you better understand the syntax used, let's break it down.<br/>

In this instance, the openssl command reverses the encryption 
of the file with a secure symmetric cipher, <br/>
as indicated by AES-256-CBC. <br/>
The -pbkdf2 option is used to add extra security to the key, <br/>
and -a indicates the desired encoding for the output. <br/>
The -d indicates decrypting, while -in specifies the input file <br/>
and -out specifies the output file. <br/>
The -k specifies the password, which in this example is ettubrute. <br/>


__Hash Function__ <br/>

__Non Repudiation__ <br/>

>The concept that the authenticity of information can't be denied. 


__Rainbow Tables__ <br/>

> Is a file with weak passwords and their hashes. 


__Salting__ <br/>

> Additional protection to strengthen hash functions. 
> Is a random chain of characters added BEFORE hashing.

> for origrammers working in Python


__Indentation__

> Space added at the beginning of a line of code


__str()__

> Converts the input object into a string


__len()__

> Return the number of elements in an object
> Ex. id_chars = len(employee_id)


__method__

> A function that belongs to a specific data type


__.upper()__

> Returns a copy of the string in all uppercase letters


__.lower()__

> Return a copy of the string in all lowercase letters


__INDEX()__

> A number assigned to every element in a sequence of a STRING that indicates its position
> We can get more than 1 character with _slices:_
> Ex. print("Hello"[0:4]) returns "Hell". 
> The first number is the start, the second, where to stop (but not to show!)


__.index()__

> Method that finds the first occurrence of the input
> in a string and returns its location
> Ex. print("HELLO".index("E"))
> To find the index of letter "E" in "HELLO"


__.insert()__

> Adds an element in a specific position inside a list

```python
my_list = ["a","b","c"]
my_list.insert(1,"ab")
# now is ["a","ab","b","c"]
```


__.remove()__

> Removes the first occurrence of a specific element in a list

```python
my_list = ["a","b","c"]
my_list.remove("ab")
# now is ["a","b","c"] again
```

__Algorithm__

> A set of rules that solve a problem


### REGULAR EXPRESSIONS

#### +

> Represents one or more occurrences of a specific character
> Ex. "a+" can get: "a", "aaaa"

### \w

> Matches with any alphanumeric character
> but it does not match symbols
> Ex. "\w" can get "1","c"

### \w+

> This combination can get: "security", "abc123", "192"


### .

> Any character


### \d

> All digits

```python
import re
print(re.findall("\d","h32rb17"))
# ['3','2','1',7']
```

### \s

> Spaces


### \.

> Period.


### Combinations

```python
import re
print(re.findall("\d+","h32rb17"))
# ['32','17']
```

```python
import re
print(re.findall("\d{2}", "h32rb17 k825t0m c2994eh"))
# ['32', '17', '82', '29', '94']
```

```python
import re
print(re.findall("\d{1,3}", "h32rb17 k825t0m c2994eh"))
# ['32', '17', '825', '0', '299', '4']
```

```python
# IP pattern !!!!
pattern = "\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}"
```



### with

> Handles errors and manages external resources


__open()__

> Opens a file in Python

```python
with open("login_atempts.txt", "r") as file:

```

__.read()__

> Converts files into strings

```python
with open("login_atempts.txt", "r") as file:
  file_text = file.read()

print(file_text)
```


## Parsing

> The process of converting data into a more readable format


__.split()__

> Converts a string into a list

```python
with open("login_attempts", "r") as file:
  file_text =  file.read()

usernames = file_text.split()

def login_check(login_list, current_user):
  counter = 0
  for i in login_list:
    if i == current_user:
      counter = counter + 1
  
  if counter >= 3:
    return "Cuenta bloqueada"
  else:
    return "You can log in"

login_check(usernames, "eraab")
