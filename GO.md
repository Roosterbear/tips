# Go

## Hello world

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
  fmt.Printf("Hello World Hacker!")
}
```

## Principles

>A Go program must has .go extension and hast to be compiled
>A Go program must starts with a package name
>A Go program must import every package that uses
>A Go program use the main function to start
>You must capitalize variables from a package (like fmt.Println)
>The most common numeric types are: float64 and int.
>Declare a variable as: var name int = 1
>Use the short declaration: name := 1
>Format your code, specially you want to share it: go fmt program.go
>Compile: go build program.go and then exec our program
>Compile without creating or saving the executable: go run program.go
>Runes are simple characters in single quotations and may contain almost any character
>Go does not allow useless variables
>We can not use parenthesis in loops and conditions
>In packages use lowercase ALWAYS, no dashes, underscores or Capitalize
